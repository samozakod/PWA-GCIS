## Summary
A [Progressive Web App](https://ionicframework.com/docs/core-concepts/what-are-progressive-web-apps) built using [Ionic Angular](https://ionicframework.com/docs/angular/overview), featuring both open-source code and libraries, such as [leaflet](https://github.com/Leaflet/Leaflet) or [ngx-translate](https://github.com/ngx-translate/core), and inspired by the Ionic team's [Conference App](https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-conference-app).

The program can be accessed on both desktop and mobile devices, by opening its respective [GitHub Pages link](https://samozakod.github.io/PWA-GCIS) (also found in this repository's 'About' section).

## Further reading
This software is part of a [thesis](https://ddd.uab.cat/record/317301) that explores the implementation of PWAs as an auxiliary tool for tourism-dependant administrations. Although the final result follows this line of thought while centered around a specific town, the web app can be used as a blueprint for a plethora of other use cases. Thanks to the latter, aside from distributing the program as a template, one can also modify it as needed to fit other areas outside of its original purpose.
